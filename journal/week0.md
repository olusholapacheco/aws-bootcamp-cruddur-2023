# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture
#My week 0 - "We must always be prepared for the fact that the listener may be stupid.” I had to start with this quote because I did the work twice because I didn't #follow instructions. I spent hours working on a 1hour video, and ended up doing it twice. I finally arrived and glad I was silly enough to not have followed #instructions the first time. Now, I feel twice as smart.

#This is my first time of using Github and this stuff is candy store cool kind of amazing

#What I achieved in week 0:
#I set up MFA for my AWS root account again. Moved from google authenticator to Authy, this way I don't lose my access if I lose my phone
#Set up permissions for my admin/user account to view billing and create billing
#Set up access keys for my user account
#Added gitpod extension to browser and was able to get the gitpod button on my github account using the edge browser, it doesn't comsume as much data as chrome
#Used cloudshell 
#Re-installed AWS CLI on my local machine

#Used sts get-caller-identity to pull up my user details (equivalent of whoami in linux). It shows User ID, ARN and more

#My challenges.
#Netweork time out.
#Didn't read instructions and failed at the end during the cloudwatch set up
#Realized I had saved the json files in the wrong folder. 
#Thankful for the previous error, now I know how to do it

#Another little challenge, realized I am soon to max out on my gitpod credits. But there us is always a way.

#So far, this is such rich knowledge I hope I can one day say thank you
