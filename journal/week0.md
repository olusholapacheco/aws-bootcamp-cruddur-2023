# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

My week 0 - "We must always be prepared for the fact that the listener may be stupid.” I had to start with this quote because I did the work twice because I didn't follow instructions. I spent hours working on a 1hour video, and ended up doing it twice. I finally arrived and glad I was silly enough to not have followed instructions the first time. Now, I feel twice as smart.

This is my first time of using Github and this stuff is candy store cool kind of amazing

What I achieved in week 0:

Install and Verify AWS CLI-

I set up MFA for my AWS root account again. Moved from google authenticator to Authy, this way I don't lose my access if I lose my phone
Set up permissions for my admin/user account to view billing and create billing
Set up access keys for my user account
Added gitpod extension to browser and was able to get the gitpod button on my github account using the edge browser, it doesn't comsume as much data as chrome

Used cloudshell, even though I have used both the cloudshell and AWS CLI before 
Re-installed AWS CLI on my local machine

Used sts get-caller-identity to pull up my user details (equivalent of whoami in linux). It shows User ID, ARN and more. Also set up aws configure to ensure I don't have to enter details everytime I use AWS on the CLI

Create a Budget - Cropped out part of my user account number for safety.

Lucid Chart - I am not great at drawing, but I managed to recreate the lucid chart following the instructional video

#My challenges.

Netweork time out. The whole nation experienced network black outs for hours and days intermittently
Didn't read instructions and failed at the end during the cloudwatch set up
Realized I had saved the json files in the wrong folder and got the error below. everything else worked until this point.

Thankful for the previous error, now I know how to do it

Another little challenge, realized I am soon to max out on my gitpod credits. But there us is always a way.

So far, this is such rich knowledge I hope I can one day say thank you
